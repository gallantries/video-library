assembly/assembly-with-preprocessing:
  description: This tutorial guides you through the preprocessing of sequencing data
    of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from early COVID-19 patients
    in China. Since such samples are expected to be contaminated signficantly with
    human sequenced reads, the goal is to enrich the data for SARS-CoV-2 reads by
    identifying and discarding reads of human origin before trying to assemble the
    viral genome sequence.

    of the most popular file format in climate science. It is used for storing multidimensional
    scientific data variables such as temperature or humidity, and metadata can be
    added to facilitate sharing of netCDF data. netCDF is widely used outside the
    Climate Science community and each community has its own set of conventions, especially
    for metadata. The Climate and Forecast metadata convention, also called CF-convention
    is used by the Climate community and is designed to promote the processing and
    sharing of netCDF files.'

genome-annotation/funannotate/tutorial:
  description: 'Genome annotation of eukaryotes is a little more complicated than
    for prokaryotes: eukaryotic genomes are usually larger than prokaryotes, with
    more genes. The sequences determining the beginning and the end of a gene are
    generally less conserved than the prokaryotic ones. Many genes also contain introns,
    and the limits of these introns (acceptor and donor sites) are not highly conserved.


    In this tutorial we will use a software tool called Funannotate (Palmer and Stajich
    2020) to annotate the genome sequence of a small eukaryote: Mucor mucedo (a fungal
    plant pathogen).

    1) to agnostically detect pathogens (What exactly is this pathogen and what virulence
    factors does it carry?) from data extracted directly (without prior cultivation) from a
    potentially contaminated sample (e.g. food like chicken, beef, etc.) and sequenced using
    Nanopore, and 2) to compare different samples to trace the possible source of contamination

statistics/classification_machinelearning/tutorial:
  description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply
    multiple classification algorithms on the Quantitative structure-activity relationship
    (QSAR) dataset to predict the biodegradable activity of chemical compounds. QSAR
    models attempt to predict the activity or property of chemicals based on their
    chemical structure. To achieve this, a database of compounds is collected for
    which the property of interest is known. For each compound, molecular descriptors
    are collected which describe the structure (for example - molecular weight, number
    of nitrogen atoms, number of carbon-carbon double bonds). Using these descriptors,
    a model is constructed which is capable of predicting the property of interest
    for a new, unknown molecule. In this tutorial, we will use a database assembled
    from experimental data of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry
    to create a classification model by applying simple and complex classifiers to
    learn the nature of biodegradation. We will use this model to classify new molecules
    into one of two classes - biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Different visualisations
    are used to analyze the results after applying each classification algorithm.
    Hyperparameters of one of the classifiers are also optimised.

statistics/regression_machinelearning/tutorial:
  description: The talk includes a lecture followed by a hands-on session to apply
    multiple regression algorithms on the DNA-methylation dataset to predict biological
    age. In this tutorial, we will build a regression model for chronological age
    prediction, based on DNA methylation. This is based on the work of Jana Naue et
    al. 2017, in which biomarkers are examined to predict the chronological age of
    humans by analyzing the DNA methylation patterns. Different machine learning algorithms
    are used in this study to make an age prediction. It has been recognized that
    within each individual, the level of DNA methylation changes with age. This knowledge
    is used to select useful biomarkers from DNA methylation datasets. The CpG sites
    with the highest correlation to age are selected as the biomarkers (and therefore
    features for building a regression model). In this tutorial, specific biomarkers
    are analyzed by machine learning algorithms to create an age prediction model.
    Multiple visualisations are also used to analyse the predictions made by simple
    and complex regressors and hyperparameters of one of the regressors also optimised.

single-cell/bulk-music/tutorial:
  description: 'Bulk RNA-seq data contains a mixture of transcript signatures from

    several types of cells. We wish to deconvolve this mixture to obtain

    estimates of the proportions of cell types within the bulk sample. To

    do this, we can use single cell RNA-seq data as a reference for

    estimating the cell type proportions within the bulk data.


    In this tutorial, we will use bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, including

    matrices of similar tissues from different sources, to illustrate how to infer

    cell type abundances from bulk RNA-seq.

single-cell/scrna-case_cell-cycle/tutorial:
  description: |
    Single-cell RNA sequencing can be sensitive to both biological and technical variation,   i
    which is why preparing your data carefully is an important part of the analysis. You want
    the results to reflect the interesting differences in expression between cells that relate
    to their type or state. Other sources of variation can conceal or confound this, making it
    harder for you to see what is going on.

    One common biological confounder is the cell cycle. Cells express
    different genes during different parts of the cell cycle, depending on whether they are in
    their growing phase (G1), duplicating their DNA (the S or Synthesis phase), or dividing in
    two (G2/M or Mitosis phase). If these cell cycle genes are having a big impact on your
    data, then you could end up with separate clusters that actually represent cells of the
    same type that are just at different stages of the cycle.

    In this tutorial, we will identify the genes whose expression is known to vary during the
    cell cycle so that we can use them to regress out (or remove) the effects of the cell cycle
    on the clustering.

    Concepts of causal inference in epidemiology have important ramifications
    for studies across bioinformatics and other fields of health research. In
    this workshop, we introduce basic concepts of epidemiology, study design,
    and causal inference for bioinformaticians. Emphasis is placed on addressing
    bias and confounding as common threats to assessing a causal pathway in a
    variety of study design types and when using common forms of analyses such
    as GWAS and survival analysis. Workshop participants will have the
    opportunity to create their own structural causal models (DAGs) using
    dagitty and ggdag and then use this model to determine how to assess an
    estimated causal effect. Examples using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma will be
    used to show how multivariable models can be fitted depending on the
    hypothesized causal relationship. Presented successfully at BioC2021 to a
    large audience of more than 100, updates that material by revising current
    examples based on participant feedback as well as content updates.

bioconductor/bioc2022_tidytranscriptomics/tutorial:
  description: |
    This tutorial will showcase analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data
    following the tidy data paradigm. The tidy data paradigm provides a standard
    way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column,
    each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand
    vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across
    manipulation and analysis functions.

    This can be achieved with the integration of packages present in the R CRAN
    and Bioconductor ecosystem, including tidySingleCellExperiment and tidyverse.
    These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a
    tidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis. For more
    information see the tidy transcriptomics blog.

    This workshop consists of a demonstration of using DECIPHER and SynExtend for
    common analyses in comparative genomics. The immediate goal of this session
    is to use sequence data to uncover networks of functionally associated genes.
    These networks consist of genetic regions under shared evolutionary pressure,
    which have previously been shown to imply some degree of conserved function.

  description: |
    The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is a key
    strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the
    gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data
    analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the
    results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this
    workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland,
    demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter
    and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method,
    linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential
    expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced
    by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results
    so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete
    analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which
    researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into
    biological insights using Bioconductor.

  description: |
    RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a very widely used technology for
    profiling gene expression. One of the most common aims of RNA-seq profiling
    is to identify genes or molecular pathways that are differentially expressed
    (DE) between two or more biological conditions. This article demonstrates a
    computational workflow for the detection of DE genes and pathways from RNA-seq
    data by providing a complete analysis of an RNA-seq experiment profiling
    epithelial cell subsets in the mouse mammary gland. The workflow uses R
    software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project and covers all
    steps of the analysis pipeline, including alignment of read sequences, data
    exploration, differential expression analysis, visualization and pathway
    analysis. Read alignment and count quantification is conducted using the
    Rsubread package and the statistical analyses are performed using the edgeR
    package. The differential expression analysis uses the quasi-likelihood
    functionality of edgeR.

  description: |
    Advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies that measure the
    transcriptome of biological samples have revolutionised our ability to
    understand transcriptional regulatory programs that underpin diseases
    such as cancer. We recently published singscore - a single-sample, rank-based
    gene set scoring method which quantifies how concordant the transcriptional
    profile of individual samples are relative to specific gene sets of interest.
    Here we demonstrate the application of singscore to investigate
    transcriptional profiles associated with specific mutations or genetic lesions
    in acute myeloid leukemia. Using matched genomic and transcriptomic data
    available through The Cancer Genome Atlas we show that scoring of appropriate
    signatures can distinguish samples with corresponding mutations, reflecting
    the ability of these mutations to drive aberrant transcriptional programs
    involved in leukemogenesis. We believe the singscore method is particularly
    useful for studying heterogeneity within specific subsets of cancers, and as
    demonstrated, singscore has the ability to identify samples where alternative
    mutations/genetic lesions appear to drive transcriptional programs.
