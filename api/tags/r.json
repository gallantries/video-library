In\nthis workshop, we introduce basic concepts of epidemiology, study design,\nand causal inference for bioinformaticians. Emphasis is placed on addressing\nbias and confounding as common threats to assessing a causal pathway in a\nvariety of study design types and when using common forms of analyses such\nas GWAS and survival analysis. Workshop participants will have the\nopportunity to create their own structural causal models (DAGs) using\ndagitty and ggdag and then use this model to determine how to assess an\nestimated causal effect. Examples using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma will be\nused to show how multivariable models can be fitted depending on the\nhypothesized causal relationship. Presented successfully at BioC2021 to a\nlarge audience of more than 100, updates that material by revising current\nexamples based on participant feedback as well as content updates.\n",

Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across\nmanipulation and analysis functions.\n\nThis can be achieved with the integration of packages present in the R CRAN\nand Bioconductor ecosystem, including tidySingleCellExperiment and tidyverse.\nThese packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a\ntidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis.
