We wish to deconvolve this mixture to obtain\nestimates of the proportions of cell types within the bulk sample. To\ndo this, we can use single cell RNA-seq data as a reference for\nestimating the cell type proportions within the bulk data.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, including\nmatrices of similar tissues from different sources, to illustrate how to infer\ncell type abundances from bulk RNA-seq.\n",

If you can have a run-through of a basic python coding introduction, then that will help you make more sense of this tutorial, however you’ll be able to make and interpret glorious plots even without understanding the Python coding language. This is the beauty of Galaxy - all the ‘set-up’ is identical across computers, because it’s browser based. So fear not!",
