Training sessions are pre-recorded and the material provided in advance in the program below. Whenever you're ready to get started, you can access the material by clicking in the respective days of the program. Everyday there are specific slots where you can meet the experts (check the schedule each day), ask questions and discuss ideas.\n\n<br>\n\n## LET'S GET STARTED!\n\n{% include button.html link=\"/events/mtb-ngs/program.html\" label=\"Start the Course!\" colour=\"yellow\" buttonsize=\"large\" %}\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n### Day 1 - **WELCOME!
