**Now**

This is the final day of all the teachers being here all of the time, so ask your questions! Don't be afraid to ask! There is some information at the end of the program about certificates and a feedback survey

**Tomorrow**

The instructors will be taking some much needed rest :sleeping:

**The next few days**

We'll be sending you a survey (also linked to from the last item in the program).  We need your feedback! Was this week useful to you? Say thank you by filling it out. :pray: :wave:

Instructors might be around, but, less so than before. Feel free to keep using Slack, but you can also ask any training quesions in the [GTN Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby), or the [Galaxy Help Forum](https://help.galaxyproject.org/?utm_source=smorgasbord&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=smorgasbord2022)


**Continute your Galaxy adventure**
All the materials from this week will stay online. Forever. You can keep learning, and keep asking your questions (here or in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby)).

Please also consider joining the [Galaxy Community Conference](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2022/) this summer (with lots of training!), or signing up for the [Galaxy Mentoring Program](https://galaxy-mentor-network.netlify.app/) to get personalized guidance around Galaxy!
