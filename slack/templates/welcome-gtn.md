:sparkles: **Let's Get Started!** :sparkles:

This is probably  different kind of training than you have attended before. This is completely _asynchronous_ workshop. There are tutorials and recordings online, and you are free to go through these at your own pace.

For this training week there is *no fixed schedule*, instead we provide a set of modules for you to choose from. This week YOU make the schedule, YOU decide which tutorials to follow, and when to start, stop, and take breaks. Find modules which are interesting to you.

:computer: **Doing the tutorials** :computer:

Whenever you're ready to get started, find the module of interest in your track, and:

1. Join the Slack channel for that tutorial (found below video) and let us know you are starting the tutorial!
2. Start the video and enjoy! All information you need for the tutorial can be found below the video, and on the GTN tutorial page.
3. Done with a tutorial? Leave a message in the Slack channel with your thoughts about it and/or thanking your instructors!

:question: **Questions** :question:

When asking a question:

1. Ask in the appropriate place (#general for general issues, or the tutorial specific channel.)
2. Use threads as much as possible
3. Share your Galaxy history ([instructions](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_sharing.html)). This makes it easier for instructors to help you!
